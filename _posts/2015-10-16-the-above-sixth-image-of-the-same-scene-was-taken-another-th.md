The above sixth image of the same scene was taken another three days later on Sol 1836\. Note that the strange object is now completely gone from the left side of the cracked rock as though it never existed at all and does not appear elsewhere in this scene. Note also that the crack in the rock in its upper area now appears to be closing or at least minimized. So how could this be happening and what the heck is going on here?
